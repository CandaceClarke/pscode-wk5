// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

Ask for two numbers (a,b)
Add a+b=x
Print solution "(x)"

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

Ask for number (a)
Check if number is divisible by 2
	If a/2 is an integer, print "even"
	If a/2 is not an integer, print "odd"

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

Ask for 5 separate numbers (a,b,c,d,e)

Calculate the average of five numbers (a,b,c,d,e)
	Add a+b+c+d+e=x
	Divide x/5=y
	Print "(y) is average"
	
Compare numbers (a,b,c,d,e)
	Determine minimum value from input numbers
		Check if a<b and a<c and a<d and a<e
			If yes, then print "a is minimum"
		Check if b<a and b<c and b<d and b<e
			If yes, then print "b is minimum"
		Check if c<a and c<b and c<d and c<e
			If yes, then print "c is minimum"
		Check if d<a and d<b and d<c and d<e
			If yes, then print "d is minimum"
		Check if e<a and e<b and e<c and e<d
			If yes, then print "e is minimum"
	Determine maximum value from input numbers
		Check if a>b and a>c and a>d and a>e
			If yes, then print "a is maximum"
		Check if b>a and b>c and b>d and b>e
			If yes, then print "b is maximum"
		Check if c>a and c>b and c>d and c>e
			If yes, then print "c is maximum"
		Check if d>a and d>b and d>c and d>e
			If yes, then print "d is maximum"
		Check if e>a and e>b and e>c and e>d
			If yes, then print "e is maximum"
